# Guidelines for Developing More Secure Web Applications

### General Recommendations

1. **Ensure your web application is designed to use encryption (HTTPS) by default for all network operations and ensure that the processes are in place to renew HTTPS certificates.**
   - Implementing HTTPS is crucial for securing data in transit. It protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Regularly renewing certificates ensures that your encryption remains valid and trusted.

2. **Employ a content security policy (CSP), employing the following CSP best practices: [tbd]; use the same CSP in development and production.**
   - A CSP helps mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks by specifying which sources of content are trusted. Consistency between development and production environments reduces the risk of misconfigurations.

3. **When selecting open source libraries, frameworks, build tools, or similar, take into account open source security best practices - e.g., consider the following Scorecard metrics: [tbd].**
   - Evaluating open source components based on security metrics helps ensure that the libraries you use are actively maintained and have a good security track record, reducing potential vulnerabilities in your application.

4. **Ensure all developers working on the project are using multi-factor authentication to access the source repository.**
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an additional layer of security by requiring more than one form of verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to your codebase.

5. **Have a documented security policy including how you want people to notify you of security issues in your application (in a `SECURITY.md` file).**
   - A clear security policy fosters transparency and encourages responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities, allowing you to address issues promptly and maintain user trust.

6. **Perform a threat modeling exercise for your web application.**
   - Threat modeling helps identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities in your application architecture, enabling you to proactively address risks before they can be exploited.

7. **Implement effective monitoring and logging to detect and respond to security incidents.**
   - Monitoring and logging are essential for identifying suspicious activities and responding to incidents in a timely manner. This practice helps in forensic analysis and improving overall security posture.

### Front End Recommendations

8. **Prevent injection attacks by validating and sanitizing user inputs.**
   - Input validation and sanitization are critical for preventing injection attacks, such as SQL injection and XSS. Ensuring that user inputs conform to expected formats helps mitigate these risks.

### Back End Recommendations

9. **Use package managers such as NPM to automatically manage dependencies and enable updates.**
   - Package managers streamline the process of managing libraries and dependencies, ensuring that you can easily update to the latest versions, which often include important security patches.

10. **Monitor known vulnerabilities in your web app's direct & indirect dependencies.**
    - Regularly checking for vulnerabilities in both direct and transitive dependencies helps you stay informed about potential security risks and take action to mitigate them.

11. **Keep dependencies (i.e., libraries, polyfills, frameworks, etc.) reasonably up to date.**
    - Keeping dependencies up to date minimizes the risk of exploitation through known vulnerabilities. Regular updates should be part of your development lifecycle.

12. **Do not push secrets (such as encrypted tokens or passwords) to a repository.**
    - Storing sensitive information in version control can lead to accidental exposure. Use environment variables or secret management tools to handle sensitive data securely.

13. **Enforce a policy in your repository to review before accepting changes.**
    - Implementing a code review process helps catch potential security issues before they are merged into the main codebase, creating a culture of security awareness among developers.

14. **Validate and sanitize all server-side requests to prevent unauthorized access.**
    - Ensuring that all incoming requests are validated and sanitized helps protect against unauthorized access and various types of attacks, such as server-side request forgery (SSRF).

15. **Lock down your server coniguration**
    - Ensure that configuration files (e.g., web server, application) are not publicly accessible.
