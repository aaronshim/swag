This is the repository for the [SWAG Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/swag/). This group is run as an open community and is coordinating with other industry bodies including [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org), [OWASP](https://owasp.org) and the [Open JS Foundation](http://openjsf.org). The work of this group stems from the [output of the Secure the Web Forward workshop](https://www.w3.org/2023/03/secure-the-web-forward/report.html).

Our current working documents are:
* [Guidelines for developing more secure web applications](https://github.com/w3c-cg/swag/blob/main/docs/security_guidelines.md)
* [Security Guidelines for Framework & Library Developers](https://github.com/w3c-cg/swag/blob/main/docs/guidelines_for_libraries.md)

This group is open to anyone to join. If you would like to join, please visit [this page](https://www.w3.org/community/swag/join). You will be asked to create a W3C account if you do not have one already. If you are affiliated with a [W3C Member organization](https://www.w3.org/membership/list/) then you will have to ask your Advisory Committee represenative to add you to the group.

We are using the [W3C Community Slack](https://w3ccommunity.slack.com/archives/C079JKV32RX) to organize and do work asynchronously between meetings. Our minutes are [posted in this repo](https://github.com/w3c-cg/swag/tree/main/meetings) after every call.
