## PR review

Looking at PR https://github.com/w3c-cg/swag/pull/12 to expand on HTTPS guideline.

- should we have more resources than just Mozilla's, on TLS config? Perhaps but not a blocker for this PR, can add it later.
- should we justify recommendation using something like https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/web-https ?

**we agree to merge**

## Limit use of 3rd party script...

Will: in security guidelines doc the title is "Limit the use of third-party scripts and resources" but the body is all about using SRA... the title is not matching the content.

...Also a guideline on CSRF... I want to write a page on MDN about it.. I'm drafting a page on MDN on CSRF.. that will feed into a guideline.  

PR to MDN on sanitizing user input... How we could do better on MDN ... 

Trusted Types PR: https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/37917 is in review
