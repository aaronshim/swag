# SWAG CG Minutes - Mon 11 November 2024

Present: Dan, Siyhhmone, Aaron

## General Topics

Dan: Spoke at Dev Con Bucharast last week...

Simone: Demographics of web developers ...  https://stateofhtml.com/en-US  ...



## Next week's call 

Aaron - to do a talk on XSS Mitigations - tools-based approach to mitigating XSS. A lot of academic studies on why it's difficult to adopt trusted types and CSP and other technologies to resist XSS. So how can we provide some tooling - semi-automnated tooling to skew developers in the right direction - e.g. CSP Evaluator, Trusted types helper extension, Safety-Web (developer-side tooling) e.g. code scanner that detects problems in code.  Next steps: introducing APIs that nudge developers towards safe practices - e.g. "safevalues".

Dan: We'll do that on the 18th and I'll blast it out to some additional channels...  We'll do it on zoom and record it.
