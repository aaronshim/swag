# SWAG CG Minutes - Mon 28 October 2024

Present: Dan, Will, Aaron

## Security group for web-features

Dan: will be presenting at dev con romania next week partly on security.

Will: working on listing security features and also short-description (https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/blob/main/docs/guidelines.md#descriptions) for CSP

- https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/pull/2061
- related to https://github.com/w3c-cg/swag/issues/2

Will: I'm looking at the list they have to see what of what they have is a "security feature" - if others are interested in commenting that could be helpful.

## Security and privacy principles

Dan: looking at https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/ I thought it might be useful to think about which security features (from that list) could be useful to implement each privacy principle that is aimed at "websites" - that is, applicable to web developers... Will file an issue.

Will: related : whether you need to employ a particular protection on your site is related to what you're doing - so if you're dealing with user data then you need to worry more about XSS. 

Dan: [sensitive info](https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/#hl-sensitive-information) definition in privacy principles might be useful.

Will: worth mentioning things that are not that obvious... 

## CSP for Angular (and other frameworks)

Will: want to add into CSP docs on MDN - the idea of tooling support for writing CSP. Should file an issue for tool support for CSP... whether we shoild call out particular tools or call out the idea of it...

Dan: we should avoid blessing specific tools but talking ..   Start from principle and then point to specific examples in specific tools - as long as there are multiple tools to point to. something something multiple implementations.

Will: also there are things that tools can't do - which is useful to call out.

Will: I will follow up by filing an MDN issue to talk about auto CSP... Either in general terms or refering specific to angular, or if we can find multiple instances doing that...

Aaron: not much info in terms of documentation (yet, since the deadline is only for code and not documentation) but to give context [on Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/28663) - the tl;dr is that auto CSP is not widely used in tooling landscape yet. We're going to await feedback between releases 19 and 20. Right now it's opt in. We'd like to move it to opt out.

Dan: any blog post about the feature?

Aaron: yes on the google bughunters blog... will also get some of it to the angular blog... 

Dan: we could get W3C to help amplify that...

Dan: also channel this back through this group and the W3C, so we can talk about it as well.

## a more formal scheduling process?

Aaron: I'd like to share a talk with this ...

Dan: let's schedule for monday the 11th of November...
