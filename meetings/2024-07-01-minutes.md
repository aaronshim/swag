# SWAG CG Call - Mon, 1 July 2024

### Present: Dan, Simone Onofri, Florian, Tom Schuster, Simon, Dan Veditz


# Introduction

- Dan
  - We'll use the Cyrptpad for minutes, at the end of each meeting I'll move on our GH repo, such as https://github.com/w3c-cg/swag/blob/main/meetings/2024-06-28-minutes.md
  - We have the github repo at https://github.com/w3c-cg/swag/ (under W3C CG orga)
  - Last week we strated to think about weekly calls and reviewing existing documentation.
  - Understand how users and web app developer are going to use these documents
 
  
- Simone
  - connection between specs and web developer - e.g. how to use CSP - also things like xz library attack - 
  - driving to a safer web

  
- florian - from the survey - web developers find it challenging to understand security threats, the browser security model.... we're working on improving security documentaiton on MDN... Ideal outcome is that people will find it less challenging... that people find it easier to enter this world.

- dan: beyond the draft charter, how do we organize the work?

- florian: will from OWD has written a security outline ...

- dan: do we need a separate document for how to build a component?

- florian: people write reference documentation on "here is the latest web platform feature and how to use it" but e.g. for CSP you might not even know about it..  We need to explain when do you need these new features.

- dan: starting from "what are you trying to do"?

- florian: also - what kind of attacks exist, what are the counter measures... 

- dan: since developers don't currently think security is part of their concerns we should maybe start with an argument about that.

- florian: same as... 

- dan: vision for what this group is trying to accomplish...

- dan: then after that ... tying back to user needs and therefore things developers are trying to accomplish to serve user needs...  rather than just a list of guidelines...

- florian: security considerations often talks about what can go wrong...

- dveditz: slightly contrarian view on security sections in spec - you won't be reading the csp spec security & privacy section unless ou're reading the CSP spec... A bigger problem is how do people know what they need...  I like the concise guide - but now as you get deeper "i'm using security x to do this thing"...

- dveditz: "if you're writing a web applicaiton, what sorts of attacks affect you - input sanitization. output santinization, XSS, CSRF... and then what helps you  - e.g. CSP, trusted types, etc... using iframe sandboxes..." what the threats are and dangers are is the big. These problems can befall your web site...

- Dan: that's an argument for starting with the treat model...

- dveditz: in a more reference presentation... even if you have people more advanced - they may have heard of XSS, CSRF... some languages have built in...   Are we limiting it to "the web" html - a lot of problems are in the server code - and that can be in a variety of languages...

- Simone: a lot of injection attacks... think about URLs... people don't want to know only what can go wrong but also the solutions... the guidelines must be contextualized... in specific libraries...

- dveditz: a common issue is pushing things to the client that the server needs to be dealing with...  so "don't trust the client"  for frameowrks you need to be worrying about higher level things... when people roll their own frameworks - they stuff data into attributes - and then they use a sanitization library that doesn't know about what attributes they're using...  that comes up with frameworks because some of the frameworks have magic values... functional things that are in there but are changeable if you're not careful. a sanitizer will strip the onclick handler out of a tag ... but a you migght have a data-something that gets interpreted as a callback and the sanitizer doesn't know to strip it...

* intro - and vision of what we're trying to achieve
* general threats - common threats
  * injection, etc...,
* "pure html, dom, js, CSS" - front end - writing a web site
  * threats
  * practices and mitigations
* using a framework - front end - writing a web site
  * threats
  * practices and mitigations
* writing libraries, components, frameworks
  * threats
* what happens on the server end - which can be a variety of languages
  * threats
* http server configuration
  * threats
  
- florian: matches a lot of will's proposed structure: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p1GtjmTd1uQrO2PRb_uUflAfQpEsfs7hBaopYeuoPMM/edit#heading=h.ck74bmw37a7r - also onboarding people into a security mindset - including "security 101"... the theory area of the content... 

- dveditz: a very basic 101 ... then go off to a deeper level of info ... 

- florian: the theory part might be important ... like for CORS... a lot of developers don't know how to deal with this...

- dveditz: people are designing for the usual customers who are using the web site nicely 

- Simon: i am a big fan of the web security 101 section... the most important is to get people a starting point - the low hanging fruit.  explain what the problems might be.

- dveditz: starting with a simple list like that ... 

ACTION: give feedback on will's document...
