- Discussion of Charter

Tobie: developer best practices and sub-topics... feels like the work is cut out already... feels very reasonable to me as main focus of the group. to what degree a lot of the work should be getting organized into actually doing it. So what should our deliverables be and what should the way of working be?  Maybe easier to work in smaller groups [after we decide that]? How much do we feel collectively that it's clear that we want to work on...

Tobie: we have received some support from alpha-omega to do some stuff like this for jquery... we didn't get into documentation... beyond jquery.  A useful first step would be documenting what currently exists...

Simon: there is documentation in OWASP and some in MDN... and also defining which of these things we want to do...Specifically, explaining technologies e.g. CSP or providing guides on how to deal with specific threats

Florian: Will Bamberg's outline for MDN https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p1GtjmTd1uQrO2PRb_uUflAfQpEsfs7hBaopYeuoPMM/edit#heading=h.ck74bmw37a7r

Dan: Also putting OpenSSF best practices on the pile, e.g. https://best.openssf.org/Concise-Guide-for-Developing-More-Secure-Software

Tobie: where the documentation is and how easily findable it is... are important. Reports are great but what's better is evergreen content.  There should be a structure / process around it to make sure it's sustaibale. 

Simon: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html and the rest of the series https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/index.html

Tobie: scope is so potentially big - looking at the charter, i resonate with this ... the intersection between security and web.

Jan: OWASP was that - join of security & web people - we might want to look at these... 

Simon: a lot of this exists but in a very inacccessible format... 

Florian: https://github.com/web-platform-dx/developer-research/blob/main/mdn-short-surveys/2023-05-15-security-dx/interpretation.md survey indicated that a lot of MDN readers find unerstanding the security challenges difficult to understand. Running such a survey again and trying to improve things might be a good idea. Involves talking to them.  Better tutorials... etc... 

Jan kowalleck:   some OWASP web related projects: (just some examples from [OWASP project list](https://owasp.org/projects/))
- https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/ 
- https://owasp.org/www-project-vulnerable-web-applications-directory/
- https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-model/
- https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/
- https://owasp.org/www-project-common-lifecycle-enumeration/
- https://owasp.org/www-project-cheat-sheets/
- https://owasp.org/www-project-automated-threats-to-web-applications/

Dan: https://github.com/ossf/package-manager-best-practices/blob/main/published/npm.md, https://best.openssf.org/SCM-BestPractices/

Dan: *about package managers and the web developer workflow*

Tobie: lots of these terms i don't even know ... there's a gap between security people and others...  It would be great if web developers know about the 10 top ones ... and if they never made one of those mistake in the top 10 concerns the security of the web would sky-rocket... 

Jan: *concerns with focusing on top 10 lists*

Tobie: client side vs back end code ... low naging fruit.. CVEs - half of them are code injection... 

Florian: at the workshop we had one key finding - there is gatekeeping going on in the security world... security experts and only they would know how to make things secure - and that contributes to the fact that front end web developers don't know about security...

Jan: yes .. have seen that developers don't care about security... but also the industry pushes for that because security is not considered part of job roles... where dedicated people know about security...  Secops guy teaches others have to do security...  so who are our audience?  should we educate font end developers?

Dan: shift left...  we raise the bare on basic security knowledge... 

Tobie: intersection between different roles... e.g. understanding what a threat model is, etc...
