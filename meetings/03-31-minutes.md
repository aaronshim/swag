# SWAG Minutes - Mon 31 March 2025

Present: Dan, Aaron, Simone, Will

## [PR17](https://github.com/w3c-cg/swag/pull/17)

Will: I made some changes based on Aaron and Chris de Alma's feedback.

Dan: I think we can merge

Aaron: ... frame ancestors .. browsers who do not support csp 2 are very obsolete ... so we should discourage people from using browsers from the 2010s...

Will: I don't see any downside... because of the way frame ancestors work... so that's the key thing for ne.

Aaron: Agree with you... we are also trying to push for deprecation of unsafe and obsolete browsers... 

Dan: [evergreen TAG finding](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/evergreen-web/)

Aaron: do we have a solution to gey people to upgrade... developers sometimes have the power to nudge user behavior with a minimum supported version

Dan: we could call for obsolete browser support to be deprecated ...

Dan: [creates issue](https://github.com/w3c-cg/swag/issues/20)

**broad agreement to merge**

## Issues

fetch metadata: https://github.com/w3c-cg/swag/issues/13

Possible [defenses](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/defenses/isolation-policies/) that can be implemented using Fetch Metadata headers

Will: I've been poking at this for CSRF... 

Simone: we can put it on the agenda for the next call...

## New Members

We have new members but they haven't been onboarding.

**ACTION: Dan: to update github page to point to the page explaining how to join.**

## Standardized Public Outreach

Aaron and colleagues have a XSS talk at [BSides Seattle](https://www.bsidesseattle.com/), how can we do a callout to this group?

Dan: Call to action is the guidelines documents-- have a look, see if it makes sense, and what other things do you feel need to be in there? Open an issue, write a PR... join the call!

Simone: We need more web developers so that we can get more requirements

## XS-leaks page on MDN

Still in progress, will hopefully get a draft out this week.
