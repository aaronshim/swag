# SWAG CG Minutes - Mon 28 April 2025

Present: Aaron, Will

## Meeting Link

Source of truth is at https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/swag/calendar/. Meet link seems to be staying consistent for now at https://meet.google.com/stw-nqxg-kqw

## XS-leaks guide on MDN

- https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/38977
- waiting for expert review
- Aaron will find someone and/or review it himself

## Future Topics for OWD

- Which other attacks are worth covering on MDN?
  - Supply chain?
  - MITM?
  - XSRF?
- Is one of these worth doing more than others?
  - Which of these are actionable?
  - Focus on the mitigations for the potential attacks
    - Which of the suggestions we want to give are easy to implement?
    - Something that developers should do but is not as widely spread in the ecosystem as we want to?
- For example, MITM
  - It's "solved" but maybe important to explain to developers why?
  - To stress the best practices that we already have out there
- What about supply chain?
  - Are all the solutions more operational? (i.e. have a policy for adding 3p dependencies, use dependabot?)
  - TODO: Brainstorm with Dan, what are the technical controls that are "easy" that we can provide/suggest to the community?
- What about XSRF?
  - Are we coming from the angle of SWAG or MDN?
  - Unless devs are being intentionally careless and overriding the parts that are "solved" by most modern frameworks, it's hard to introduce?
  - But still a problem because there's tons of legacy code from before we had "solutions" that might be out-of-scope for new web devs where we want to give SWAG-focused advice?
  
## Quick advertising updates

- Quick shout-out to SWAG in the slides for Aaron's BSides Seattle XSS talk
- Would the W3C SWAG GitHub be an appropriate place for static PDF serving of slides to talks like these (so that we can link from our docs, etc)
- Anything SWAG-esque to include in the Angular v20 promotion materials for Auto-CSP?
  - Such as what? Maybe guidelines? Angles for how to sell features like these?
  - Can mention that the MDN documentation on CSP is now aligned with these approaches!
- Are we meeting in-person at TPAC this year?
  - OWD probably will!
- [Docs CG](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/docs-cg/) also started!
