#Â SWAG CG Minutes - Mon 25 November 2024

Attendees: Dan, Benjamine, Aaron, Will, Simone, Estelle

## New Friends

Benjamine: working for Capital One...

## Videos for last week's call

Simone: I need all the email addresses for the participants...

*Aaron to provide*

## Follow-ups from last week

Dan: I'd like to start going on https://github.com/w3c-cg/swag/blob/main/docs/guidelines_for_libraries.md

Aaron: Is this more like a checklist of properties that we officially think a library developer should follow? Or just a grab-bag of useful techniques, etc?

Dan: it's a set of guidelines - not strict conformance requirements...

Aaron: If it's just a collection of guidelines/techniques, we are ready to start talking about specific topics e.g. Dom XSS mitigations ... 

Aaron: an avenue to surface ... data from scans ...  Maybe a github repo that is the outputs of these scans... Is there some UX that we can work together on under the W3C umbrella or something in conjunction with OpenSSF to make it more visible to developers?

### Trusted Types Documentation

Will: we need better docs on Trusted Types on MDN... the time for that is when it gets cross browser support... I can help with that.  Right now there is API docs on MDN but not guidance... 

Dan: it would be good to know when it will be added to baseline.

Aaron: we have a web.dev article... but if there is more material... we can share, let me know.

# W3C Security Interest Group

Simone: I'll be sending the announcement soon.  We need to synchronize on the "web threat model" - this will guide all the web developments...  Threat model will be developed in the Interest group - with coordination with SWAG... I will be one of the editors but feel free to propose one if you like...
