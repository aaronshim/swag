# Talk from Aaron, Kian and Guillaume (Google) on tooling

*Aaron presenting "Adopting XSS Mitigations: A Tool-based Approach for CSP and Trusted Types"*

Aaron: *discusses secure-by-design approach*

Dan: Noting [CISA's Secure-by-design initiative](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign) 

Aaron: *presenting [CSP Evaluator](csp-evaluator.wighgoogle.com) (also a chrome extension)*

Kian: *presenting TTHelper chrome extension*

Dan: Noting positive signals from [Webkit](https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/186) and [Mozilla](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/198) on Trusted types... (and [positive TAG review](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/198) from a while back) - however implementation in other browsers besides chrome is not complete right now. - also see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API

Guillaume: *presents on Safety-Web - static analysis tool implemented as an ESLint plugin*

Dan: q+ on trusted types : (1) cross-platform story (2) if developers should not write the policies then does that indicate it's too complex for some developers / small dev teams?

Aaron: (1) what is the most actionable UI for displaying mitigation suggestions (nudging) (2) The NPM Puzzle - both CSP and TT benefit from 3p dependencies that are compatible...  (3) why is there traditionally a large gap between web developers and security knowledge

Dan: q+ on point 2, maybe our "library guidelines"

Will: q+ on safety-web default policy: might this end up being part of the web platform?
