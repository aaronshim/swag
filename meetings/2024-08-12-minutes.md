# SWAG CG Call - 12 August 2024

Present: Dan, Simone, Aaron, Jan

## Agenda

### Call Planning

Dan: propose to cancel next week's call... Restart on the **26th of August**.

### To Score or not to Score? 

Dan: just wanted to talk about possibility of using scorecard along side of package manager (NPM) as a way to help developers gaugge security characteristics of packages: <https://mastodon.social/@torgo/112949116496768176>

Jan: some people come with the idea that scorecard can do anything but I don't think it holds value for consumers of a package.  It only tells you about current status of a project... jQuery for example... so project maintainers, repo stuff... if I pick the package from back then then the scorecard value may change... doesn't reflect the package, nor the release or anything...   I say "yes" care about it when looking at packages - choose the package that is more maintained - which is one of the characterstics measured by scorecard...   we should find out which are the criteria we care about and what they are weighted... measurement should be done in a way that isn't fakable...

Simone: Scorecard can be a proxy for something...

Aaron: At least for the information that is derived from the code in the repo, is something like this a possible solution to the "faking" solution? <https://github.com/google/oss-rebuild>

Aaron: [from chat] As a technical example, we are looking for a forum for getting visibility onto the outputs of this particular scanner: <https://github.com/google/safety-web>

Dan: this is a work item for us: what are these criteria?  

Jan: scorecard score is more about safety than security... it does say build was / wasn't tampered with (based on build pipeline analysis) and tells you the source code probably was the one that led to the output... so I could do my own research on the source code... helps to build a chain of trust.
