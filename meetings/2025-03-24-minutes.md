## MDN docs updates

- CSRF doc published: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/CSRF, thanks to mozfreddyb for reviews

- XS-leaks doc will be out for review this week

  - Aaron will find a colleague to review
  - ensure MDN and xsleaks.dev are aligned

- consider a guide to fetch metadata on MDN?
  - xsleaks.dev and web.dev already has good content. DO we need somehting on MDN as well? If we do, make sure it's aligned with xsleaks.dev

## Remaining work on attacks for MDN

Which other attacks need documentation at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks?

- supply chain?
- Mitm?
- ...any more?

Discussion:

- it is worth documenting Mitm even though it could be seen as a solved problem.
- after supply chain and Mitm we can say we are done with documenting attacks on MDN: Google's view is that the main areas needing devs' attention are injection (XSS) and isolation (XS-leaks), and we will have coverage for those.

- how can google help disseminate SWAG work? Aaron + colleagues speaking at [BSides Seattle](https://www.bsidesseattle.com/) in mid-April -- is there a brief call out to the work that this CG is doing and a brief call to action for the audience?
